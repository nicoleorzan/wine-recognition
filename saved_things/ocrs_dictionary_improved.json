Once on the palate, the\nwine opens with a full-bodied and well-balanced sensation of tropical fruit. The finish is\nlingering and rewarding, malting the Late Harvest Pinot Gris the perfect finish for a\ncelebratory evening,\n\nThe juice was inoculated in a stainless steel tank and kept outside in the November air for\nthe entire process. The high natural sugar (37.5 brix), combined with the mid-forties tank\ntemperature resulted in a slow, very controlled cold ferment and kept all bitterness\u2019s at a\nminimum. The BA11 yeast used promotes clean, aromatic characteristics and intensifies\nmouth-fee] and lingering flavors. The 5% Siegerrebe addition seems to have enabled the\nproduct to avoid that heavy cloying sense that so many dessert wines possess.
